how to clean Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
------------------------------------------------------------------

We created 1 script to help pelople to clean Human Activity Recognition
Using Smartphones Data Set available on
<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>
and help further anlaysis.

You can see the variables used in Code\_Book.md or Code\_Book.html

Basically the script R script called run\_analysis.Rdoes the following

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
each measurement. 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the
activities in the data set 4.Appropriately labels the data set with
descriptive variable names. 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a
second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for
each activity and each subject.

The output file is TIDYSET.txt
